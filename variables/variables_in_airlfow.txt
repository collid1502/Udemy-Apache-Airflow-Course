You can use a json file to store key value pairs for variables, that airflow can allow DAGs to access.
This allows you to change settings for more parameterised pipelines.

Examples could be:
    switching table names
    switching between a Dev & Prod environment etc. 

These variable can be imported into the airflow environment by:

    > go to the UI
    > go to Admin 
    > go to variables 
    > click choose file, which will allow you to select a JSON file that can be imported
    > you will then see them on the screen after a successful import
    > your DAGs can now make use of these variables
